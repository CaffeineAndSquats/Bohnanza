The files contained here are part of the Composer Hyperledger framework.
While they should work on any local installation and version of the Composer Hyperledger, the code has only been tested on the Composer PLayground.
To set up the Blockchain, visit https://composer-playground.mybluemix.net and create a new Network.
Add the files in the matching folder hierachry to the network and compile the code.
To simulate the BeanPool, we currently use a verification process that is coded into a "transaction". A more secure BeanPool will need to be implemented in future version.
